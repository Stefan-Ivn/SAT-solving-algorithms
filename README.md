Implementation of SAT solving algorithms: Resolution, Davis-Putnam, and DPLL
# SAT Solving Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of three SAT-solving algorithms:

- **Resolution Algorithm**
- **Davis-Putnam (DP) Algorithm**
- **Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) Algorithm**

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `memory_profiler` package (for tracking memory usage during execution)

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install memory_profiler
